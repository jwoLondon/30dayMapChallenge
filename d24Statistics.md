# 30 Day Map Challenge, Day 24: Statistics

_This document best viewed in [litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis)_

## Initial Thoughts

Twitter wags like to suggest that _x% of statistics are made up_. This joke is often repeated, but with different values for _x_. But which are more common, and where? I have collected tweets featuring variations of this joke over a ten year period (27,346 tweets). Show the results in map and histogram form.

I don't have the georeferences of the tweets, so will need to make these up (i.e. 50% of the submission will be made up (geo) and 50% genuine (frequencies)). Could use other georeferenced tweets as a proxy or some other measure of population location.

## Data Preparation

1. x% of statistics are made up tweets collected between 2007 and 2017 and filtered with regular expression

   ```sh
   ".+(%|[P|p]ercent).+[S|s]tatistics.+[M|m]ade up.+"
   ```

2. Geolocations taken from [OS OpenNames](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html#OPNAME) and combined and filtered into a TSV file of populated places:

   ```sh
   cat *.csv >combined.csv
   grep  "populatedPlace" combined.csv >popNames.csv
   ruby -rcsv -e 'CSV.foreach(ARGV.shift) {|row| print row[2],"\t",row[8],"\t",row[9],"\n"}' popNames.csv >gbPopNames.tsv`
   ```

3. Made up geolocations generated by randomly sampling 27346 locations from `gbPopNames.tsv` and combining with the _x%_ value from each of the tweets, where _x_ is extracted with the regular expression:

   ```sh
   (\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*(%|[P|p]ercent)
   ```

Location of generated files:

```elm {l}
path : String -> String
path file =
    "https://gicentre.github.io/data/30dayMapChallenge/" ++ file
```

## Map Design

The data collected are not georeferenced, which makes challenge for mapping. Randomly attaching each x% to a location associated with a place name in GB gives something a distribution that is credible, even if disproportionately weighted towards rural place names.

Need to combine the mapped data with the frequency distribution (which is the interesting and non-made-up part of the data).
