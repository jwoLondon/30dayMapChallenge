# 30 Day Map Challenge, Day 10: Black and White

_This document best viewed in [litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis)_

## Initial Thoughts

Lots of choices here. [Cycling profile map](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/12351/7/wood_visualization_2015Postprint.pdf)?

Something that contrasts day and night? Could map Steve Abraham's One Year Time Trial heatmap for daylight and nighttime hours.

## Data Preparation

Steve's GPS data of were downloaded daily from Strava during 2015. Using location and timestamp of each GPS location, each point was classified as either in daylight or nighttime. The collection of day and night GPS points were converted into two density grids at a resolution of 300m. The grid was resampled to 600m cells and all non-zero grid cells were saved as a point files `abrahamDayPoints.csv` and `abrahamNightPoints.csv`.

Location of generated files:

```elm {l}
path : String -> String
path file =
    "https://gicentre.github.io/data/30dayMapChallenge/" ++ file
```

## Map Design

Adjacent day and night maps in a two-tone style.
